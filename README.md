## Overview
This repository contains R scripts and an RMarkdown file used to analysis the impact of gaming - specifically Animal Crossing: New Horizons - on mental health and well-being in 2020. The data was pulled from the Data Science Bank's repository and the dataset is titled "A multinational dataset of game playersâ€™ behaviors in a virtual world and environmental perceptions". The main purpose of this report was understand if the game has a real positive impact on mental health and how it accomplishes it if it does so.

The final report can be viewed [here](https://github.com/ChristinaChanYing/Animal-Crossing-Analysis/blob/main/outputs/paper/animal-crossing-analysis.pdf).
